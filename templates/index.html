                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4">Michele McCulloch began a lifelong fascination with music at age 4, upon hearing Beethoven and Burl Ives playing simultaneously. Born into a family of artists, she came quickly to hear sound as they saw color, and marveled at the endless possibilities as she experimented upon their ancient piano. Growing up surrounded by all manner of paint and sonic stimulation, she eventually threw herself into hot water by studying Composition at Sonoma State University, acquiring skills on various instruments along the way, as any composer would. Michele had not counted on falling madly in love with the cello and the gamelan, but these things do happen. Extraordinary teachers inspired her in wildly divergent ways. Anne Crowden, founder of the Crowden School in Berkeley, brought passion, energy, hilarity, and deep understanding into every teaching moment. Anne’s chamber music instruction was incomparable. I Wayan Suweca, founder of the gamelan orchestra Sekar Jaya, a Balinese drummer with great tenacity and devotion to his art, opened doors to new worlds of sound, and provided fuel for compositions. David Sheinfeld (composer and violinist in the San Francisco Symphony) helped to nurture her love of counterpoint. While playing at the Conservatory of Music in San Francisco, she met Laurette Goldberg, whose lively instruction breathed Life and Humor into the world of Early Music. Michele played in numerous baroque ensembles around the Bay Area, including a season under Nicolas McGegan with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. Since then she has played with various chamber groups, some locally and some abroad, focusing on early music, or music from other cultures or centuries, (she can be spotted rarely playing in Irish pub sessions).  In 2011, she joined forces with violinist Julie Egger and Julian Smedley to form The Convergents, exploring completely improvised music - a magical, transportive experience. Most recently, she has been happily making music with the band Poetic Ruckus, a group that defies any genre. Michele currently lives on a small farm in Pt Reyes Station with her husband Michael, where they both play as much music as the neighbors will tolerate and tend as many vegetables as their family can consume. They are presently conducting a study of the effects of Trumpet Fanfares on Tomatoes.</p>

                        <p style="color:#652868" class="mb-4">James Moseley is a Vocalist and Guitarist influenced by the Temptations, Marvin Gay, Jimi Hendrix, Wes Montgomery, and many more.  James started his musical career in Columbus Ohio at the age of 15.

                            In 1980, a recording opportunity brought James to California, and he has been making music in the Bay Area ever since. Notably, he formed and led The James Moseley Band, a 9-piece dance band covering R&B, blues, reggae, and jazz and original compositions for 18 yrs. Most recently, he became a member of Poetic Ruckus, an original music string quartet, founded by violinist Julie Egger.
                            
                            James is also a UC Berkeley graduate and Certified Public Accountant. When not performing, he can be spotted around town with a briefcase in one hand and a guitar case in the other.
                            
                            James lives in Novato, CA with his wife of 28 years.  Between them they have six children, twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.  Music is an important part of their family life.</p>

In high school she was a member of the “Long Island Youth Orchestra” and traveled with them around the world.   Julie attended Manhattan School of Music and Crane School of Music where she studied with the Julliard String Quartet.  Julie then went on to teach music and perform with many ensembles throughout her life.  When Julie lived in Boston, she performed with a milieu of musicians as well as teaching violin and working as a Special Education Teacher. In 1989, Julie moved to California where she continued her passion for music.   She performed with the Red Hot Chachkas (a Klezmer fusion band) in the Bay Area for 18 years, Convergents, a trio performing improvisational music and at present Poetic Ruckus, a quartet of all original music.   Julie has composed pieces for both the Red Hot Chachkas and Poetic Ruckus.  She is ardent with her playing and when performing hopes to transform her audience.   Julie currently lives in West Marin with her husband Al and dog Jude.
